Bible

Blessed is the man who doesn't walk in the counsel of the wicked, nor stand in the way of sinners, nor sit in the seat of scoffers; but his delight is in Yahweh's law. On his law he meditates day and night. He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water, that brings forth its fruit in its season, whose leaf also does not wither. Whatever he does shall prosper. The wicked are not so, but are like the chaff which the wind drives away. Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked shall perish.

Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. 

Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. 

The unexpected is our normal routine. Ensign Babyface! Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. Computer, lights up! This is not about revenge. This is about justice. This should be interesting. 

Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship.
